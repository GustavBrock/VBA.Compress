### Zip and Cabinet Folders
Set of functions to zip, unzip, compress, and decompress zip and cab (cabinet) files and folders for both 32- and 64-bit VBA.
No third-party tools used.

Windows Explorer let you handle zip folders nearly as any other folder: Copy, move, change, and delete, etc., and also open cabinet files.
In VBA you can also handle normal files and folders, but zip and cabinet folders takes a little more - and that you'll find here.
