### Zip and Cabinet Folders
Set of functions to:

- *zip* and *unzip* zip files and folders
- *compress* and *decompress* cab (cabinet) files and folders

for both 32- and 64-bit. No third-party tools used, only a single code module.

### Zip Folders
![General](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GustavBrock/VBA.Compress/master/images/GitZip.png)

Windows Explorer let you handle zip folders nearly as any other folder: Copy, move, change, and delete, etc., and also open cabinet files.
In VBA, you can also handle normal files and folders, but *zip* folders takes a little more - and that you'll find here.

### Cabinet Folders

Windows Explorer lets you open cabinet (cab) files like any other folder. In VBA, you can easily handle normal files and folders, but opening and indeed creating *cabinet* files takes a lot more - and that's you'll find here.
